# Purple Team

## What Purple Teaming Is

Purple Teaming is a collaborative security approach that aligns Red Team (offense) and Blue Team (defense) activities to continuously improve detection, response, and resilience.

**Key idea:**
- Red Team tests how attacks work  
- Blue Team tests how defenses respond  
- Purple Team ensures both sides learn and improve together  

> Purple Teaming is not a separate team by default, but a working model.

## Why Purple Teaming Exists

Traditional Red and Blue Teams often operate in silos:
- Red finds issues → report delivered  
- Blue fixes later → limited feedback loop  

Purple Teaming improves this by:
- Creating real-time feedback  
- Reducing defensive blind spots  
- Improving detection quality faster  

**Core outcome:**  
Faster improvement than Red or Blue alone.

## Purple Team Composition

Purple Teaming includes members from both sides:

**From the Red Team**
- Penetration testers  
- Ethical hackers  
- Adversary emulation specialists  

**From the Blue Team**
- SOC analysts  
- Incident responders  
- Threat hunters  
- Security engineers  

> Everyone works toward shared defensive goals.

## Purple Team Purpose

### 1. Improve Security Defenses
- Translate attack techniques into:
  - New detections  
  - Better alerts  
  - Improved controls  

---

### 2. Enhance Detection & Response
- Validate whether attacks are:
  - Detected  
  - Investigated correctly  
  - Escalated on time  

---

### 3. Enable Continuous Improvement
- No one-off exercises  
- Continuous refinement of:
  - Detection logic  
  - Playbooks  
  - Tooling  

---

## Core Purple Team Objectives

### Collaborative Security Testing
- Red executes attacks  
- Blue defends in real time  
- Joint observation of:
  - What triggered alerts  
  - What was missed  
  - Why it worked or failed  

> This removes guesswork.

---

### Knowledge Sharing & Skill Development
- Red shares:
  - TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures)  
  - Evasion methods  
- Blue shares:
  - Detection logic  
  - SOC workflows  
  - Response constraints  

**Outcome:**  
Better attackers and better defenders — internally.

---

### Continuous Monitoring & Adaptation
- Joint review of:
  - New threat intelligence  
  - Emerging attack paths  
- Proactive tuning of detections  
- Prevention of repeated failures  

---

### Enhanced Incident Response
- Practiced coordination  
- Faster decision-making  
- Reduced confusion during real incidents  

> Purple Teaming turns exercises into muscle memory.

## How Purple Teaming Typically Works

1. Select an attack scenario (e.g., phishing → lateral movement)  
2. Red Team executes agreed techniques  
3. Blue Team defends and investigates  
4. Joint review:
   - Detection gaps  
   - Alert noise  
   - Response delays  
5. Improve:
   - SIEM rules  
   - EDR policies  
   - Playbooks  
6. Repeat with new techniques

## Purple Team vs Red vs Blue

| Team        | Focus            | Goal                    |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Red Team    | Attack simulation| Expose weaknesses       |
| Blue Team   | Defense & response| Protect & recover       |
| Purple Team | Collaboration    | Improve both            |

> Purple Teaming maximizes return on security testing.

## Metrics Purple Teams Care About

- Time to detect  
- Time to respond  
- Detection coverage per technique  
- False positive reduction  
- Repeat attack success rate  

---

## Governance & Culture

- Blameless learning environment  
- Shared success metrics  
- Executive support required  
- Documentation and follow-through essential
